Install everything from requirements.txt in a venv if possible

Add a discord.env in students-assistant that contains the code I gave you

Add the models to the models/ folder in flask_chatbot_student_assistant/

Run :
- start-discord-bot.ps1 
- start-flask.ps1

In two terminals

And done :)
(I guarantee nothing if there is a problem good luck ahah)
